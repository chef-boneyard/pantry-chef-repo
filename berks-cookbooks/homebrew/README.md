Homebrew Cookbook
=================
This cookbook installs [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) and replaces MacPorts as the *default package provider* for the package resource on OS X systems.

This cookbook is now maintained by Opscode. The original author, maintainer and copyright holder is Graeme Mathieson. The cookbook remains licensed under the Apache License version 2.

Requirements
------------
### Prerequisites

In order for this recipe to work, your userid must own `/usr/local`. This is outside the scope of the cookbook because it's anticipated that you'll run the cookbook as your own user, not root and you'd have to be root to take ownership of the directory. Easiest way to get started:

```bash
sudo chown -R `whoami`:staff /usr/local
```

Bear in mind that this will take ownership of the entire folder and its contents, so if you've already got stuff in there (eg MySQL owned by a `mysql` user) you'll need to be a touch more careful. This is a recommendation from Homebrew.

### Platform

- Mac OS X (10.6+)

The only platform supported by Homebrew itself at the time of this writing is Mac OS X. It should work fine on Server edition as well, and on platforms that Homebrew supports in the future.


Attributes
----------
- `node['homebrew']['owner']` - The user that will own the Homebrew installation and packages. Setting this will override the default behavior which is to use the non-privileged user that has invoked the Chef run (or the `SUDO_USER` if invoked with sudo). The default is `nil`.
- `node['homebrew']['auto-update']` - Whether the default recipe should automatically update homebrew each run or not. The default is `true` to maintain compatibility. Set to false or nil to disable. Note that disabling this feature may cause formula to not work.
- `node['homebrew']['formulas']` - An Array of formula that should be installed using homebrew by default, used only in the `homebrew::install_formulas` recipe.
- `node['homebrew']['casks']` - An Array of casks that should be installed using brew cask by default, used only in the `homebrew::install_casks` recipe.

Resources and Providers
-----------------------
### package / homebrew\_package

This cookbook provides a package provider called `homebrew_package` which will install/remove packages using Homebrew. This becomes the default provider for `package` if your platform is Mac OS X.

As this extends the built-in package resource/provider in Chef, it has all the resource attributes and actions available to the package resource. However, a couple notes:

- Homebrew itself doesn't have a notion of "upgrade" per se. The "upgrade" action will simply perform an install, and if the Homebrew Formula for the package is newer, it will upgrade.
- Likewise, Homebrew doesn't have a purge, but the "purge" action will act like "remove".

#### Examples

```ruby
package 'mysql' do
  action :install
end

homebrew_package 'mysql'

package 'mysql' do
  provider Chef::Provider::Package::Homebrew
end

package 'wireshark' do
  options '--with-qt --devel'
end
```

### homebrew\_tap

LWRP for `brew tap`, a Homebrew command used to add additional formula repositories. From the `brew` man page:

```text
tap [tap]
       Tap a new formula repository from GitHub, or list existing taps.

       tap is of the form user/repo, e.g. brew tap homebrew/dupes.
```

Default action is `:tap` which enables the repository. Use `:untap` to disable a tapped repository.

#### Examples

```ruby
homebrew_tap 'homebrew/dupes'

homebrew_tap 'homebrew/dupes' do
  action :untap
end
```

## homebrew\_cask

LWRP for `brew cask`, a Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration
of Mac applications distributed as binaries. It's implemented as a homebrew
"external command" called cask.

[homebrew-cask on GitHub](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask)

### Prerequisites

You must have the homebrew-cask repository tapped.

    homebrew_tap 'caskroom/cask'

And then install the homebrew cask package before using this LWRP.

    package "brew-cask" do
      action :install
    end

You can include the `homebrew::cask` recipe to do this.

### Examples

    homebrew_cask "google-chrome"

    homebrew_cask "google-chrome" do
      action :uncask
    end

Default action is `:cask` which installs the Application binary . Use `:uncask` to
uninstall a an Application.

Usage
-----
We strongly recommend that you put "recipe[homebrew]" in your node's run list, to ensure that it is available on the system and that Homebrew itself gets installed. Putting an explicit dependency in the metadata will cause the cookbook to be downloaded and the library loaded, thus resulting in changing the package provider on Mac OS X, so if you have systems you want to use the default (Mac Ports), they would be changed to Homebrew.

The default itself ensures that Homebrew is installed and up to date.
